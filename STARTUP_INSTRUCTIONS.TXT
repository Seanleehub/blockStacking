Getting started on the robot assignment
---------------------------------------

The startup pack for the Robot assignment contains four files:

   - Robot.class
   - SomeListener.class
   - RobotControl.java
   - RobotMain.java

Your task for this assignment is to implement the code for controlling the
movement of the robot for various scenarios in the control() method of the
RobotControl class.

You do not need the source code for the Robot or SomeListener classes as they
are designed to work as long as you supply a valid RobotControl.java file.

Ways of working on assignment 1B:

A) Console Programming

   If you plan to do your robot assignment using a text editor and 
   compiling/running the program from a command prompt then you need
   to obtain the console-friendly version of the robot startup code 
   "Robot-Ass1B-Console.zip", extract the startup files archive
   wherever you wish to keep your assignment 2 program and edit the
   "RobotControl.java" file.

   You can run the robot as shown in the assignment specification 
   (ie. java Robot).

B) Using Eclipse

   If you wish to use eclipse then you should follow the instructions 
   for importing the "eclipse-friendly" version of the startup files - 
   make sure you do each step exactly as shown or the Robot may not 
   run correctly.

   The file you will be editing is still "RobotControl.java".
   
   If you are using eclipse then you can run the Robot class even though
   you do not have the source code for it.
   
   To supply the command line arguments for changing the bar and/or block
   heights you need to:
   
      A) Select the "Run Configurations" option from either the "Run" menu
         or the run quick-launch button (click on the small triangle
         next to the run button)
         
      B) Go to the "Arguments" tab
      
      C) Enter the values for the bar and/or block heights in the 
         "Program Arguments" window
         
      D) Click on the "Run" button
